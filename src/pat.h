 * Patricia Tree package
 *
 * $Id: pat.h,v 1.1.1.8 2007/05/09 20:41:46 sachin Exp $
 *
 * This package allows the use of variable length keys to be stored
 * in a patricia tree.
 *
 * It is based on code in gated-3.5R11 from Cornell University in the
 * mid 1990's written by Dennis Ferguson. It was extracted and put in
 * a library by Tom Pusateri in 1997.
 *
 * To use this package, just embed an "patext" element in your data
 * structure. This will contain the size of the key and a pointer to
 * the key. It can be placed anywhere in the user's data structure.
 * The user is responsible for allocating storage for the key itself.
 *
 *	typedef struct _mynode {
 *	    ...
 *	    patext	my_extkey;
 *	    ...
 *	} mynode;
 *
 * A routine like the following can be used to map between a
 * patext and the user's data structure.
 *
 *	static inline mynode *
 *	pat2my (patext *ext)
 *	{
 *	    return((mynode *)((int) ext - offsetof(mynode, my_extkey)));
 *	}
 *
 * The following routines can be used to set/get key info.
 *
 *  void    pat_key_set(patext *keynode, u_char *key)
 *  u_char *pat_key_get(patext *keynode)
 *  void    pat_keysize_set(patext *keynode, u_int keysize)
 *  u_int   pat_keysize_get(patext *keynode)
